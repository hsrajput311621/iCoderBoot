                        language. Its design philosophy
                        emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically-typed
                        and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured,
                        object-oriented and functional programming.Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,capable of exception handling (from the start plus new capabilities in Python 3.11) and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.Its implementation began in December 1989. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.</p>

                    <p class="lead">C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level general-purpose programming language
                        created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming
                        language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++
                        now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for
                        low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many
                        vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
                        Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platformsC++ was designed with systems
                        programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with
                        performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.C++ has also been
                        found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
                        resource-constrained applications,including desktop applications, video games, servers
                        (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g.

                        designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose
                        programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning
                        that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to
                        recompile.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
                        virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
                        similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime
                        provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
                        typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
                        popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client–server
                        web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
